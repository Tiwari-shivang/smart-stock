Awesome—here’s a clear, “build-it-like-a-pro” plan. I’ll keep it simple, practical, and tied to what’s in your two docs (I’ll cite those bits). Where I’m giving extra opinion (frameworks, DBs), I’ll say so.

What to build first (sane sequence)

Wire up data & baseline.

Connect to the corrugator’s sensors/PLCs and start collecting 1-second data (temp, moisture, speed, etc.). Get a small time-series store up and graph basic trends & waste KPIs.

Ship an operator UI shell (web + mobile).

A minimal dashboard + alert feed (read-only). Prove the “mobile operator interface” early.

Real-time “guardrails” (MVP).

Online anomaly detection on the live stream (Half-Space Trees) so you can raise early warnings. Keep it fast on an edge PC.

Short-horizon prediction.

Add a sequence model that looks a few minutes ahead (TCN ≈ 4.2-minute prediction horizon) so operators act before waste shows up.

Turn signals into simple actions.

Map detections → 1–3 clear steps (e.g., “reduce speed slightly; raise steam; recheck”). Aim to surface recos in <30s.

Before-run risk scoring.

Add a light tabular model (LightGBM/XGBoost) to flag risky orders before you start; show why (SHAP).

Setup/changeover optimization (Phase-2).

Learn better startup settings/sequence (HMM + Bayesian optimization bounds like steam 170–200 °C, glue gap 0.5–1.5 mm, etc.).

Order/recipe/scheduling optimization (Phase-2/3).

Pareto trade-offs (NSGA-II), better sequencing (Genetic Algorithm). Nice-to-have after guardrails work.

This sequence matches the 2-week “FlashPod” delivery rhythm in your docs: patterns → real-time prediction → mobile alerts → optimization.

Tech stack***************************

Here’s a clean, short stack that fits your use case:

Mobile app

Flutter (Dart) — one codebase for Android/iOS, smooth UI, good offline/kiosk support.

Optional: PWA (web app) for the corrugator console browser.

Backend

Python FastAPI for APIs (REST + WebSocket).

OPC-UA/Modbus/S7 connector via gateway (e.g., Kepware) or python-opcua.

Messaging: MQTT (plant ↔ edge/backend), optional Kafka for durable streams.

Data: TimescaleDB (Postgres) for 1-sec sensor data, PostgreSQL for app data, Redis for caching.

Deploy: Docker (+ K8s later), on-prem edge + cloud.

Real-time detection

Python: river (Half-Space Trees) for streaming anomalies, PyTorch (TCN/LSTM) for 3–5 min look-ahead, XGBoost for order risk, SHAP for “why”.

Export models to ONNX; run with onnxruntime on an Edge PC for sub-second inference; alert via WebSocket/MQTT.
