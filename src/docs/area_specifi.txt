‚ö† Notes & Adaptations

Some SKUs may not be legal or allowed in all districts (e.g. tobacco regulations, frozen meats) ‚Äî check local regulation in Vietnam.

The local flavor is critical: Vietnamese snacks (rice crackers, shrimp chips), local juices, and condiments will have strong presence.

In urban areas and premium stores, you may also see imported / premium goods (Japanese snacks, imported chocolates, imported coffee) in addition to local SKUs.

For fresh / perishable goods (like bread, occasionally fresh fruit), many convenience stores in Vietnam lean toward packaged / shelf-stable versions because cold-chain and spoilage are risk factors.

For services or non-goods SKUs (mobile top-up, bill payments), these are often integrated but not ‚Äúinventory SKUs‚Äù per se.
